# Clipboard Landing Page

This is a fully responsive landing page for a generic "Clipboard" app for iOS and Mac. Though simple, the design is totally suited for outlining the app's benefits and encouraging visitors to try it out.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  HTML & CSS **only**!

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write  _something_. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

This project has been tremendously helpful in helping me apply my front-end knowledge to a practical endeavour. Here, I use pure HTML and CSS, with the extensive help of **Flexbox** and **Grid**.

Given a Figma file with both mobile and desktop designs, I started working mobile-first, and work my way up to the design desktop using media queries.

The goal was to give a highly professional feel to the website, and to make it responsive no matter the screen size (from 350px to WQHD+ and beyond).

## Optimizations

The most critical optimization would be to refactor everything using a framework like React.

Another optimization would be the code structure itself, as right now the whole code is in a single HTML file and CSS file.

## Lessons Learned:

Instead of jumping into the next technologies right away, I sticked to working with HTML and CSS, which gave me an essential skill foundation and will make my journey as an engineer easier once I dwelve into frameworks like React.

Flexbox and Grid are amazing tools that I needed to implement in a real project. The level of challenge allowed me to further increase my proficiency in these basic - but crucial - properties.
