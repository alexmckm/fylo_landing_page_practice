## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  HTML & CSS **only**!

This project has been tremendously helpful in helping me apply my front-end knowledge to a practical endeavour. Here, I use pure HTML and CSS, with the extensive help of **Flexbox** and **Grid**.

Given a Figma file with both mobile and desktop designs, I started working mobile-first, and work my way up to the design desktop using media queries.

The goal was to give a highly professional feel to the website, and to make it responsive no matter the screen size (from 350px to WQHD+ and beyond).

## Optimizations

The most critical optimization would be to refactor everything using a framework like React.

Another optimization would be the code structure itself, as right now the whole code is in a single HTML file and CSS file.

## Lessons Learned:

Instead of jumping into the next technologies right away, I sticked to working with HTML and CSS, which gave me an essential skill foundation and will make my journey as an engineer easier once I dwelve into frameworks like React.

Flexbox and Grid are amazing tools that I needed to implement in a real project. The level of challenge allowed me to further increase my proficiency in these basic - but crucial - properties.
